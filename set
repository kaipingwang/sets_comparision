Name     Method                   Features               Comments                              Example
vector   index and push_back   1. dynamical allocation   produce a new array to copy old one   vector<vector<int>>grid(3, vector<int>(4))
                               2. save the space for memory
                               3. not well support insertion 
                                  and delete 
                               4. only push and pop in the end of vector
                                  (not sure)
                               
List     no index, but push_back  1. no internal memory
                                  2. non-continuous memory
                                  3. easy to insert and delete
                                  4. enable to push and pop in the start and 
                                     end of vector
                                  5. more space consumption
                                  6. no random vist
                                  
Map      <key, value> and no index  1. efficient to search             has iterator 
         insert, make_pair          2. no-upfront memory
         
Set      Sorted and unique value    1. no repeat value insertion       has iterator
